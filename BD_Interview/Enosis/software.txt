More of them were from array. Some of them from object oriented programming. They gave some code and we had to find errors in them. And the last part was related to database and Q/A related. Features of phone,error of an adder.

Interview Questions
If a monkey can climb 3 mtrs up and fall 2 mts down per day.how many days it would take to climb a height of 29 mtrs.

Interview
They take a written exam at first. On that result, they select for coding session. Usually, they give 2 problems each with 25 minutes. In the coding session, 2 recruiters will be in the same room and will watch you coding.

Interview Questions
Basic analytical and coding test



Interview
The whole process is divided into 3 parts.

1. Written test
2. Coding test
3. HR interview

Tests are pretty easy. They don't change their questions. It's being repeated over years. It's more like you getting questions before attempting the tests.

Interview Questions
1. Find multiples of 3 between 200-0. And more.


Interview
Written was easy simple programming and the analytical question then Coding was on the repetitive question on string and map. Try to get the questions. Try to get the questions

Interview Questions
Write a function to reverse a string


Interview
A written test with easy math, programming problem, testing and debugging question.
A onsite coding test. One to one coding. A problem would be given and a laptop to code on. The interviewer can see and control the screen. They can interrupt and ask question. The coding test was conducted in C#. They give you hint and library function info if you are stuck.

Interview Questions
In the coding test I was asked to implement Wrap Text algorithm. Given a long string and a line width, modify the string to put new line so that a line has at most line width amount of character and no line break is given in the middle of a word.
I was not allowed to use split function.


Interview
I applied via an employee. I was called by the hr the very next day to appear in a mcq test a week later. The mcq test was quite easy, consisted of previous questions found in glassdoor, including basic iq test, basic problem solving, testing, finding bug etc, should be a piece of cake for any cs grad. After a week I was asked to sit in a technical interview. It was in C# and I was asked to add a new line to an input string when it exceeded a given limit of characters per line.

Interview Questions
1. add a new line to an input string when it exceeded a given limit of characters per line.


Interview
There was 3 steps overall:
1. Written Test
2. Coding Test
3. HR interview
The interview process is quite lengthy. From dropping the CV to getting the job offer, it took me almost 1.5 months.

Interview Questions

Written test consists of 15 basic questions which are already available in others posts. Except 2-3 questions, most of them are extremely basic. Few mathematical analytical questions, few basic programming question, and few questions for testing.

The coding test consist of 2 problems (one string based and another one is a tree based problem). The string based problem asked for center aligning a multi lined string. And in the second problem, they asked for adding a node to a multi rooted tree.

The coding tests duration is 50 minutes. There were 2 interviewers who constantly view the code in a projector and asks question about various matters regarding the code.

If you can successfully solve both problems, then you will surely get a call from HR in the next week.

HR will ask for various personal stuffs, future plan(don't mention about higher study plans), salary expectation and other few questions regarding extra curricular activities.


Interview
They take a written exam at first. On that result, they select for coding session. Usually they give 2 problems each with 25 minutes. In coding session, 2 recruiter will be in same room and will watch you coding.

Interview Questions
Basic string problem in coding session


Interview
All questions are almost the same as before. Questions from basic algebra. Basic programming questions like 1) Write a function that receives a string and returns the reverse of it. 2) Revere each word of a sentence. 3) print multiples of 3 from 200 to 1. Basic testing questions etc.

Interview Questions
print 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 by using only one loop

I had to take part in the written test. The test duration was one hour. The questions were programming problems, some basic maths, and testing questions. The problems were varied from easy to intermediate level.

Interview Questions
To solve problems using any programming language.


Interview
It was a very structured process to select proficient candidates. I felt that the environment there was friendly and the employees involved in the interview were very much helpful. I really appreciate it.

Interview Questions
What is the different between depth first search and breadth first search?


Interview
I gave a written test on 8th December 2020.

Post: Software Engineer

Time duration: 1 hour. (Very much careful about this time limit)

3 types of questions were in there.
- Basic Maths
- Coding questions (you have to write code)
- Software testing

All questions were coming from previous questions & interviews. You will find it in GlassDoor, Google. They will make a simple logical change in 2..3 questions maximum.
Otherwise, everything is the same.

Note: As I have already said you will get a very short time, so you have to be very careful about time. You have to practice codes.

Try to focus on coding first if your are applying for Software Engineer.

Interview Questions
String Manipulation, Array related problem, Software testing is also the basic question.


Interview
The hiring process consists of 3 steps. Written exam, coding test, and finally a face to face interview. The written test consists of 3 sections. Analytical section (4 questions), coding section (7 questions), and quality testing section.

Interview Questions
Reverse a given string word by word.


Interview
In initial stage after shortlisted they took an one hour physical written exam. The next phase is coding interview where coding in c# is preferable. After that they will take an interview for final selection.

Interview Questions
I found 3 types of questions in written exam: analytical, Basic Programming and Software testing.


Interview
1. Written Test for 1 hour
Questions covered analytical ability, basic math, basic programming, testing, etc.
2. Onsite Coding Test
There was a total of 2 questions and you have to solve them using their prefered programming laguage as forwarded in your email.
3. HR interview

Interview Questions
You'll be given some text in a file. The text in the file can be left align, right-align, or center align. You need to align those texts with the interviewer's choice.



Interview
I sent my CV on their website and got a call for a written exam after one month. Questions from the exam are quite easy but didn't solve them all in time.

Interview Questions
Reverse string in words wises not characters.


Interview
I was called for written test.
There was 3 segments.
1.Math
2.Coding
3.QA

Basic mathematics
Adhoc programming, string manipulation.
Different test cases for different UI (like in html)

The overall difficulty was average. If you are a CSE graduate and have good command over basic math, coding then you can nail the written test easily.

Interview Questions
They asked me about OOP, Data structures etc.


Interview
Three Phase Interview.
1. Written Test : 15 Questions. Math, String, Forms, Testing, Stack, Queue etc
2. Coding Test : C#, C++. Data Structures Problems and Algorithms in Visual Studio.
3. Viva : Overall Knowledge of Programming.

Interview Questions
Basic Programming and Software Testing Problems


Interview
They have 3 steps : Written ,Coding,Viva
they took 1 month overall. They called me for coding test after 25 days of written test.Then i perticipate there.Then Rejected. After every steps they will notify your result with an E-Mail and phone call.

Interview Questions
Coding test question is same as previous exam ! I dont know why they dont change their question .
First question was about center aligning string from a plain string
Second question was about binary hierarchical tree that can make parent child relationship.
If you can solve first problem ,but you cant write code for second problem they will not hire you . Make sure you can solve second problem . The question is same ,so you need to find answers from Ex- Enosis Employee at any how . A continious same tree problem can't judge you overall! Be patient, try another company if you cant hire by them

One more tipis:
They take coding interview in C# language with Visual Studio(Not Visual Studio Code). You need to complete a method function in class . You need to pass value to another method to show output .


Interview
After dropping my cv I was called for written test. There was analytical, coding and qa questions. There was five analytical question each of 1 mark and 6 coding problem each having 5 marks

Interview Questions
Reverse every word of a sentence.. like "I eat" to "I tae".
2 Answers
Remove fourth character of a string.
Answer Question
Take input from file where each line contains a integer and find average


Interview
I applied online. There was two phase of interview. First phase was written test covering basic analytical ability, basic coding question etc. Second phase was practical coding test. I was given two problems to solve. Overall process took around 1 month.

Interview Questions
Reverse words of a sentence


Interview
The interview consisted of three phases. Written test, Coding test and HR interview. Written test consisted mathematical questions, programming problems (Code writing and error tracing) and few design questions. Coding test was quite hard, there were two programming task. The first problem was easy but the second one required data structure and algorithms.

Interview Questions
While coding test the interviewer asked questions about the code I wrote, then modified the problem and asked if the logic behind the code changes or not. Then asked for alternative ways to do the task.


Interview
Same written questions repeated
4 mathematical problem, 7 coding problem ( you can write code in any language you prefer) , 5 problem related to testing,
Time one hour, try to finish quickly
There were 2 sets of Questions

Interview Questions
Oop


Interview
The first step is a written assessment. It consists of three sections - Analytical (Maths), Coding (Data structure mainly) and Quality Assurance
If you get selected you get called for a complex coding or testing session.

Interview Questions
Showed a webpage and asked the possible issues.


Interview
Well, it was a written test of 15 questions and time was 1hour. They prefer any ICPC/NCPC contestant more. So, guess that's why I didn't get my chance though my exam was great.

Interview Questions
Topics were
1. Analytical ability
2. Basic programming
3. Software testing


Interview
You have to seat for a 1 hour long written test at first. The questions are very easy. If you perform good on written test, they will call you for a coding session.

Interview Questions
For Coding session: Right align a Text, Building from parent-child relation, building tree postfix notation etc


Interview
The selection process was structured in 3 steps:

1. Written Test: Included analytical question, basic programming problem and bug identification or testing problem. The test was intended for both development and QA position.

2. Coding Test: Had to work in an existing project. Given a left aligned string and had to write function for aligning it right based on given line size and atomicity of word constraint.

3. Short Viva or Interview

Interview Questions

Answer Question
Why do you want to work as a Software Engineer?


Interview
At first an written exam was held.
Array based questions. String related problems.There are actually 7-8 programming problms.
At the end, there was 5/7 testing questions. After being selected,in the written exam, they call for the lab test.At last there, was a viva or interview phase.


Interview
There is this phase1 coding test, which tests your knowledge about Data Structure, Algorithms, OOP. You are asked to write specific functions like reversing a string, largest common subsequence. You are also asked to write some tests that you will perform when you test a calculator that does simple arithmetical operations.

Interview Questions
Find out the largest common subsequence


Interview
Submitted the cv using referral and they took a written test initially and then called for a coding test. The written test was straightforward with simple mathematical and basic coding problems. It was easy.

Interview Questions
In the written test, they asked for a few basic mathematical questions and basic coding questions.

In the coding interview, they asked the same question to everyone. So if your friend go earlier you will get the advantage.

Interview Questions
Reverse string


Interview
First, they'll call for a written exam, and based on the performance short-listed candidates will have to attend a coding test. I passed the exam and called for a coding test.

Interview Questions
Basically, they'll give basic programming problems that you can solve with any languages. Such as, playing with arrays, string manipulation, stack-queue etc.


Interview
First I had to attend a written exam. After passing the written exam, I was called to attend the coding session. I went there, solved given 2 problems and answered a few related solutions, optimization etc. So I was very happy. But Unfortunately, after 2 days, they sent me a rejection mail. I was shocked. I was really interested to know my mistakes. Anyway, they should work on their recruitment process.

Interview Questions
Written: Very basic level problems. Also they are repetitive.
Coding: Same right-alighment problem + Tree construction problem.


Interview
I applied through employee referral. The interview process is divided into three parts.
1. Written Test
2. Coding Test
3. Viva
In written test, there was 4 math questions, 6 coding questions and 5 testing and ui improvement related questions. Coding questions are fairly easy, basic string manipulation, series printing, file i/o processing. In testing Questions, a form snippet is given, you have to write test cases to test the form or denote some points to improve its UI.

Interview Questions
Q: Print the following series using only one loop.
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Interview
The sent an email requesting me to apply. After applying, the called for technical tear, code test and then HR tests. Pretty descent questions came in the exam. They know how to measure good talent.

Interview Questions
Why did you not try for govt job?



Interview
The whole interview process is split into 2 steps. Firstly, a written test is taken in their office. There were around 4 analytical questions, 6 questions asking to write some code and 5 SW testing/QA related questions. The questions are not that hard, difficulty might be similar to the easy questions of GRE. The codes were of simple problems like reversing words of a sentence, printing numbers that occur only once in an array etc. The written test was of 1 hour duration. A piece of advice, give revision if you have time, surprising mistakes can be made when you write a code on paper instead of a computer.

After the written test, if you are rejected, they notify you with an email in a few days. If you pass, they schedule a date for coding test and calls you again for that.

In the coding test, 2 problems were given. The first problem was of a string alignment conversion and the second problem was of creating a tree using a node insertion function they will provide based on a list of relationships between some entities. You might be asked about some variations of the problems or the problems from the written test as well. Some questions related to your CV may be asked too.

Interview Questions
Transform a left aligned text into a right aligned one where the maximum size of output window is given.
1 Answer
Given the relationships between some entities and a method to create a tree node (requires name of the node and reference to its parent node, i.e. you can't create a child before its parent), you have to make relationship tree of the entities.



Interview
First of all, there is a written test. The questions are pretty straightforward. There are some simple math, analytical, coding, and testing question. Next, there will be a coding test and an interview.

Interview Questions
Reverse a sentence


Interview
baisc interview with logic and other question. But they also took a coding test after that which the code must be written in c++. the coding test focuses on vector and loop.

Interview Questions
Write a code for reading all the files in a folder


Interview
Very easy and fundamental written test. Then they call for a coding test. If your competence meets their requirement, you'll get a job offer call. At every step, you'll get a mail and a call.

Interview Questions
Q1:
They will provide a code base. A function will be implemented for either right align, left align or center align of a passage. You will need to tweak the given function for expected alignment asked.

Q2:
id name parent_id
1 abcd -1
2 bcdf 1
3 efgh 2
normalNode{
id;
name;
parentId;
}
treeNode n = add(string name, treeNode parentNode) //normal
treeNode n = add(string name) //parent
make a tree out of these given list structure.



Interview
There are 3 steps of selection.
1. Written test
2. Coding test
3. Technical Interview
Each of the tests are evaluated separately. And one has to qualify each of them before getting to the next step.
Written test is taken on basic programming and analytic skills. There are some easy but tricky coding problems, mathematical problems, SQL queries and some GUI related questions. All of these can answered efficiently if the candidate has a good base in programming and subject knowledge. No preparation required. The test duration is 1 hours and location is usually the office premise.

Interview Questions
Write a function to reverse each word of a given string



Interview
I was interviewed by this company a few months ago. I was faced a written exam first. The questions was similar to previous written exam. I passed the exam and called for a technical interview. But i was rejected in that technical exam.

Interview Questions
Basic programming, analytical, testing and debugging questions
1. Find the duplicates elements among arrays.
2. Sum two numbers from the file inputs etc



Interview
First they call for written test and its was 1 hour written test. Then if you passed the written test they will call you for interview session.In interview they will check your programming skill.

Interview Questions
first they call for written test thats mean programming skill



Interview
The Interview took place in three phases:

1. Applying to Enosis Solutions.
2. Getting shortlisted for the written exam.
3. Getting shortlisted for the technical exam.

After applying and getting shortlisted for the recruitment, I went there for my written exam. There were 4 analytical problems, 6 programming problems and 5 system testing problems. We were given 1 hour of time to solve them all. So BE AWARE of time. The problems were really easy. Analytical problems were from Geometry, Basic Math, Age calculation etc. And the programming problem section was basic. If you have gone through your basic C programming course in your academic life, you shouldn't face any problem. The testing part consisted of testing different OOP classes and applications.

After some days, I got to know that I was selected for the technical exam. The technical exam will be conducted by a senior software engineer who will help you understand the environment and the problems.

The worst part begins HERE. From the very 2017, the same questions with same Visual Studio environment have been asking out to candidates and they chose candidates from the same implementation knowledge! After my technical exam, I shared my coding experience with one of my friends who was waiting for his technical exam and guess what? He got the SAME question with same environment and solved all the problems ( there are two(2) problems in total. If you can solve the first one,then you will be given the second one. )AND he got the job too! My friend has a sound programming background. Whether we had the discussion or not, he could have managed the job easily. But should it be the correct WAY for judging a candidate? Should you judge a candidate by throwing a problem to him like " this is our personal project and this is our code base, align the string from left to right " and same problem for ALL the candidate from 2017?

It took some time to understand their environment and I solved the tasks they gave to me. But I was told that I took much time in my first problem so they can't enroll me in the Software Engineer section. They further offered me in QA section and I happily declined.

Interview Questions
Align a string to right from left.



Interview
There were 3 phases. 1.Written 2.Verbal Interview 3. Coding Test
Written part was very basics from OOP, probability maths, geometry, output of a program etc.
Verbal interview consists of some technical questions based on previous works described in CV and some casual questions.
In technical test, two problems were given but beware of time.

Interview Questions
String right alignment , Map Vector Tree related problems.


Interview
At first they asked for a written exam, then interview at the premises, and then a short viva exam. After that the process is done. They are very friendly. The written test was so easy but coding test is a bit harder.

Interview Questions
What is OOP? what is vector?


Interview
A written exam that tests coding, quality assurance, and basic math logic. Candidates can choose to opt-in for what jobs they are applying for or not applying for.

If the candidate passes the exam, he/she would then attend a coding exam with an employed senior individual of Enosis. They are very helpful.

Interview Questions
The interviewer asked some basic optimization questions regarding questions in the coding exam.


Interview
They have been using the same interview process including the same questions for many years.
First, you have to attend the written test which consists of some mathematical, coding and testing problems which are quite easy.
Next, you are called in for the coding interview. You are asked to solve two questions which are also always repeated.
In the final stage, you are called by HR.

Interview Questions
You are asked to write the code for right-aligning a text in a text-box.


Interview
1. Written Exam.
2. Programming Test
3. Interview

*Written Exam was for one hour. Basic Programming Problems.
*Programming test was only for selected individuals. I think they meant to choose whom have good competitive programming background.
*Selected Individuals. Mostly to settle the salary.

Interview Questions
1. Take input from file.



Interview
At first they called for a onsite written exam where questions were to test the programming basic of the candidates.
After that I was asked for a coding test. Where one person brought me to a room where there was a laptop. And you will have to use c++ for the coding test.

Interview Questions
During the coding test they asked me to align some string to the right.


Interview Questions
Programming Question :
1. Reverse string ( input=abc, output=cba)
2. Reverse word
3. Check duplicate elements... etc

Testing Question:
1. They will give a picture of a software and tell you to find the testing features
2. Finding errors from code


Interview
They will shortlist you by going through your CV. Then you will be invited to a written test which is about 1 hour. There will be about 14-15 questions to test your coding skills. Also some analytical questions. After passing the written part you will be called for the system testing. They will inform you within 7 days whether you are selected or not. But the saddest and worst part about this company is they don't hire a girl. May be because of their personal reasons or what so. But i found it really very unfair. It's like no matter how good you are in your tests they won't hire you if you are a girl.

Interview Questions
questions are like reverse array,print multiple of 3's and also some analytical questions.


Interview
A written test is taken which was pretty easy. Simple math, easy coding problems and some questions regarding testing were given.

After that, a coding test was situated where 2 problems were asked to solve. 1st problem was to make text right aligned. 2nd problem was to output a directory like structure given a vector representing child-parent relationship. Interviewer failed to properly describe 2nd problem which was pretty disappointing.

Interview Questions
How would you implement center aligned text?


Interview
No verbal interview if I don't consider over the phone informal conversations as interviews. A written test was followed by a coding test. I felt that the Written test was too trivial to differentiate candidates. The worst part was candidates appearing for the test on different days happened to get the exact same questions. Same thing happened in the coding interview too.
Coding interview Setup was good, completing some functions in the backend of a C++ GUI application. All logical, they described the APIs to use very well. Still they could've told the candidates about the coding environment beforehand as does some online coding interviews. Still the worst part is candidates appearing on different dates get the exact same problems to solve making it really unfair for the earlier candidates.

Interview Questions
To describe myself informally


Interview
The interview process for the position of Software Engineer includes three levels. First you will be called for a written exam, after two weeks of that they will let you know if you have successfully passed the exam or not and will call you for an interview and a coding test.

Interview Questions
The written exam was of 1 hour and included the following questions:

(1) Write a function that will receive a string as an input and will return the string in reverse order.

(2) Write a function that will print the following series of numbers using only one loop:

"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1"

(3) Write a function that will print all the multiples of 3 between 1-200 ( in reverse order )

There were other programming questions as well but of the same difficulty level. Along with the coding questions there were some analytical and QA questions as well. And for me the best part of this exam was there's no language specification. You can answer all the coding questions in whichever programming language you are comfortable with.

So, after giving the exam I was impressed to know that they basically want to see how much problem solving skills do you have rather than evaluating you by the number of languages and frameworks you know.


Interview
First if you get shortlisted or manage to get a referral they will call you to sir for a written test. The test is very easy. 5-7 programming problems. anyone with basic programming knowledge can answer them . there will be 3-4 GRE standard math problems . 1-2 questions about UI/testing . and basic database questions . If you pass the written interview they will call you for a coding test . they will ask you to write some code in C++ in visual studio.

etc

coding test :
give a window size . some texts are left align , make it right align .



Interview
it was a very lengthy and boring process. first they take written exam in February. then technical interview in march. then skill test in April.

In written exam,
1. there is some basic questions from math like simple probability finding, finding age of father from son's age, angle finding, perimeter, circle related problem. very easy questions. it may have 1-2 mcq.
2. Then there is coding questions. first questions will be - what are the basic concepts of OOP and write a code to implement them. after this there will be some coding problem- like string reverse etc. Also there will be some question like- what will be the output of this code and why?
for example, you will be given a simple recursive code and draw its tree. please read about constructor calling.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 write this code in one loop.

3. then there will be sql related questions. like write sql queries. - find the max, 2nd max salary, swap two columns of two table etc. practice some query. it may have 1-2 mcq.

4. then there will be questions from QA. like difference among white,black, gray box testing. then there will be picture find out diff in those pictures, then there will be some scenario - you have to write how will you test it or how you will you improve it.
very easy questions. write as your wish.

last questions will be what is your most memorable achievement, describe... :P

for written section I write what I remember from my written exam.. Don't worry questions are very easy.

In first interview,
there will be two persons. one is hr and another is technical. first question will be describe your self...:P
then technical will ask question from your CV. most question from projects. easy basic questions. then hr will ask about your future plan,expected salary(:D), your family etc....

third time they call you for skill test.

i was given a test which was right align, i had to make it left align. you have code in visual studio 2010 in C++. it was a windows application. you just need to edit the right align code to make it left align. there is some other alignment function , they may tell you write code for them also...:P
about visual studio 10, if you write something like this:
vector<int>vc;
for(int i=0; i<vc.size();i++) // your code will not run. i faced this problem which cost me huge time.. :(

Good Luck!!!
